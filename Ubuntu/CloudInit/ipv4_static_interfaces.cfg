# configure network
# Adding "on-link: true" for each routes is recommended for the "routes(gateway)" menu in network config file of netplan otherwise netplan will calculate whether the gateway is in range of IP/prefix, if not, the network can't work normally.
# Despite adding "on-link: true" is only necessary for the situation of irregular IPv4 configs(public IPv4 address with the a private IPv4 gateway or gateway is also a public address but from A class is different from the former),
# this setting won't affect the normal IPv4 configurations.
# So in order to considering the most general availability of the various complex environments of the networkings, we should add "on-link" in all items which need to be configurated manually cloud-init files.

# Kill the original sshd service so that to liberate the occupation of "0.0.0.0:22" and "[::]:22" to avoid "error: Bind to port sth on sth failed: Address already in use." causes restarting and applying new configs failure of the sshd service.
